Create a web app using typescript.
The web app will be a clone of tiktok / instagram reels.
Use all of the youtube shorts provided in shorts.txt
This app should be optimized for mobile devices.
This app should use vertical scrolling as mobile apps do to navigate between videos.
Shorts should be ordered randomly.
Each displayed short should autoplay and loop automatically and play their original audio.
The app should display full screen (on mobile) and autoplay with an overlay on the bottom right to like and share the video.
